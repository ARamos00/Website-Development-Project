# Website Development Project — Static Portfolio (HTML/CSS)

Basic portfolio site I built for class. It’s a static front-end (no framework) with pages for **Home**, **Projects**, **Gallery**, and **Contact**, and it’s published with **GitHub Pages**.

**Live site:** [https://aramos00.github.io/Website-Development-Project/](https://aramos00.github.io/Website-Development-Project/) ([GitHub][1])

## What’s here

* **Home / About** with a short bio, skills, and experience/education sections. ([Aremos][2])
* **Projects** page highlighting two apps (Dog Walking App, Spotify Music Recommendation). ([Aremos][3])
* **Gallery** page (photos of Peluchin). ([Aremos][4])
* **Contact** page with email, phone, and a resume link. ([Aremos][5])

## Tech

* **HTML + CSS** (no JS build tooling) — repo is \~72% HTML / \~28% CSS. ([GitHub][1])
* Hosted via **GitHub Pages** from this repo. ([GitHub][1])

## Getting started (local)
