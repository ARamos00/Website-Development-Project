# Website Development Project — Static Portfolio (HTML/CSS)

Basic portfolio site I built for class. It’s a static front-end (no framework) with pages for **Home**, **Projects**, **Gallery**, and **Contact**, and it’s published with **GitHub Pages**.

**Live site:** [https://aramos00.github.io/Website-Development-Project/](https://aramos00.github.io/Website-Development-Project/)

## What’s here

* **Home / About** with a short bio, skills, and experience/education sections.
* **Projects** page highlighting two apps (Dog Walking App, Spotify Music Recommendation).
* **Gallery** page (photos of Peluchin).
* **Contact** page with email, phone, and a resume link.
